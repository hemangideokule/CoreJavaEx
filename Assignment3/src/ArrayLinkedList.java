/*
ArrayList:
ArrayList implements single linked list.
Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array.
ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.

LinkedList:
LinkedList implements double linked list.
Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list.
LinkedList class can act as a list and queue  because it implements List and deque interfaces.
