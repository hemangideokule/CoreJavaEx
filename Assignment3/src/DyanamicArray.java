/*
 In Java,the size of an array is fixed when it is created. 
 Elements are not allowed to be inserted or removed. 
 However, it is possible to implement a dynamic array by allocating a new array and copying the contents from the old array to the new one.

A dynamic array has variable size and allows elements to be added or removed.
For this, we can allocate a fixed-size array and divide it into two parts:

the first part stores the elements of the dynamic array and
the second part is reserved, but not used.
